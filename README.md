**Modifications to [ashoulson/RailgunNet](https://github.com/ashoulson/RailgunNet)** 
- Removed conditional compilation flags for `SERVER` and `CLIENT`. Uses a runtime flag in `RailRegistry` instead.
- Implemented runtime IL generation for states, events and commands.
- Added unit tests.

Based loosely on the [Quake 3](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena) and [Valve/Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_Multiplayer_Networking) networking models.

Supported Networking Tasks:
- Compact bit-packing of serialized entity data
- Delta-compression for entity data
- Network clock (frame number) sync
- Smoothing and interpolation support
- Clientside prediction support
- Scoping and packet size/QoS enforcement
- Reliable global events
- Unreliable entity/controller events

Wishlist:
- Code generation for new synced object states

Not Supported:
- Lag compensation for hit detection (see [VolatilePhysics](https://github.com/ashoulson/VolatilePhysics))
- Transport-layer network packet I/O (see [MiniUDP](https://github.com/ashoulson/MiniUDP))

Primary Design Features of Railgun:
- **Transport-Agnostic.** Railgun is not tied to the transport layer used for transmitting data over the internet. As long as a simple interface is upheld (essentially just sending/receiving unreliable byte[] arrays), Railgun can work with a number of network libraries.
- **Low-Bandwidth.** Railgun uses bit-packing and delta compression to keep bandwidth use at a minimum. Additional compression techniques (like Quake's Huffman Encoding) are also under consideration.
- **Simplicity.** Railgun is designed to be simple to read and debug. This library offers as minimal a feature set as possible to keep the total source small and readable. While Railgun could certainly benefit from features like code generation for custom object serialization, code simplicity takes a higher priority.

Caveats:
- Railgun is *not* a networking library. It provides no explicit support for UDP or TCP data transfer. Railgun is designed to sit right above such a library and use it to transmit and receive data that Railgun then interprets. For a simple UDP library that serves as a perfect companion to Railgun, see [MiniUDP](https://github.com/ashoulson/MiniUDP).
